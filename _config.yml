description: "I am a mathematician and software developer currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at NCTS, National Taiwan University. My primary languages are Chinese, English, Python, and Sage, and I have experience with HTML, CSS, JS, and C. I am well-equipped to learn new languages as needed. My research focuses on arithmetic dynamical systems and their computational problems. Currently, I am developing a fast algorithm to determine if two rational functions are compositionally related." # This will show up in places like twitter, linkedin, etc, if you share your sites url as a post.
