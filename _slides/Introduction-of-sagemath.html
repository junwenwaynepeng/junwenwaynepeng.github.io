abstract: Polarized morphisms are important objects in various mathematical and computational fields, and their composition is a fundamental operation. In this talk, we present a new algorithm to efficiently compute the composition relationship of two polarized morphisms using the concept of dynamical canonical height. Our approach utilizes the properties of dynamical systems and the theory of heights to represent polarized morphisms in a computationally efficient manner, while still allowing for flexibility in handling more complex cases. We also provide an analysis of the time and space complexity of our algorithm and compare its performance to existing approaches on a set of benchmarks. Our experimental results suggest that our proposed algorithm has the potential to outperform state-of-the-art methods and can handle a wide range of cases, which could make it a valuable tool for practical applications of polarized morphisms composition.

			### What is Sage?
			SageMath is a <em>free open-source mathematics software system</em> licensed under the GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more. Access their combined power through a common, <em>Python-based language</em> or directly via interfaces or wrappers.

	  <h3>Installation</h3>
	  <p>
    Performing composition with rational functions $f$ and $g$ is straightforward. However, decomposing a function $F$ can be a challenging task.
    $$ \frac{x^2+1}{2x}\circ \frac{2x+1}{x^2-1}=\frac{5x^2+4x}{4x^3+x^2-4x-1}$$

    	<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><strong>trivial decomposition</strong>: a decomposition $F=F_1\circ F_2$ is trivial if $F_1$ or $F_2$ is a linear map.</li>
    	<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><strong>indecomposible</strong>: we say a morphism $F$ is indecomposible if any decomposition of $F$ is trivial.</li>
