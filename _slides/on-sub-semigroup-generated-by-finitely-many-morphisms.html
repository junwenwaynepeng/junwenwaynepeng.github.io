  In the realm of category theory, an endomorphism represents a map that preserves an object's structure. This opens the door to exploring the (semi)-group structure of $\mbox{Hom}(X)$, the collection of such endomorphisms. A pivotal concept in this exploration is the Tits alternative, which classifies linear groups generated by two elements. Our presentation delves into using (semi)-group growth rates to explain the Tits alternative and its subsequent research. We'll highlight our own contribution":" a Tits alternative concerning endomorphisms of the projective line. While a general result exists, we've uncovered intricate relationships among morphisms, particularly in monomial cases. To address this, we've devised a novel algorithm.
