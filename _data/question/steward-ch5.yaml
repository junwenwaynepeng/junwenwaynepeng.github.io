  question: If $x\sin(\pi x) = \int_0^{x^2}f(t)dt$, where $f$ is a continuous function, find $f(4)$.
  answer: |
    Let $F(x)$ be an antiderivative of $f(t)$, so $\int_0^{x^2}f(t)dt = F(x^2)-F(0)$ by the fundamental theorem of Calculus. Apply differentiation to $x$ on the integral, we get $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_0^{x^2}f(t)dt\right) = F'(x^2)\cdot 2x = 2xf(x^2)$. On the other hand $(x\sin(\pi x))' = \sin(\pi x) + \pi x\cos(\pi x)$. By setting $x=2$, we conclude that $f(4) = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

  question: Suppose $f$ is continuous, $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$, $f'(x)>0$, and $\int_0^1f(x)dx=\frac{1}{3}$. Find the value of the integral $\int_0^1f^{-1}(y)dy$.
  answer: |
    The following graph explains that the integral is $1-\frac{1}{3}$. The area of the red shadow part is the integral. [Figure 1](../assets/question/steward-ch5-ProblemPlus-2)
