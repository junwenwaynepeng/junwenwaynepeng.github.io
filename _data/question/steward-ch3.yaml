  question: Calculate $y'$. $y=\frac{x^2-x+2}{\sqrt{x}}$
  answer: We simplify $y=\frac{x^2-x+2}{\sqrt{x}} = x^{3/2}-x^{1/2}+2x^{-1/2}$, so $y' = \frac{3}{2}x^{1/2}-\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}-x^{-3/2}$.

  question: Calculate $y'$. $y=\frac{\tan x}{1+\cos x}$
  answer: Applying the quotient rule, we have $y' = \frac{\sec^2x(1+\cos x) +\tan(x)\sin(x)}{(1+\cos x)^2}$.

  question: Calculate $y'$. $xe^y=y\sin x$
  answer: Applying the implicit differentiation, we have $e^y+xe^yy' = y'\sin x + y\cos x$. We solve for $y'$. We get $y' = \frac{e^y-y\cos x}{\sin x-xe^y}.$

  quesiton: Calculate $y'$. $y=\ln(x\ln(x))$
  answer: Applying the chain rule and the multiplication rule, we get $y' = \frac{1}{x\ln(x)}(\ln(x)+1)$.

  question: Calculate $y'$. $y=e^{x\sec x}$
  answer: Applying the chain rule and the multiplication rule, we get $y' = e^{x\sec x}(\sec x+x\sec x\tan x)$.
review-25:
  question: Calculate $y'$. $\sin(xy)=x^2-y$
  answer: Applying the implicit differentiation, we have $\cos(xy)(y+xy') = 2x - y'$, so $y' =\frac{2x-\cos(xy)y}{x+1}$.
review-33:
  question: Calculate $y'$. $y=\ln|\sec 5x+\tan 5x|$
  answer: Applying the chain rule, we have $y' = \frac{1}{\sec 5x +\tan 5x}(5\sec 5x\tan 5x+5\sec^2 5x)$.

  question: |
    If $f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)$, show that 
    $$\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}=\frac{1}{x-a} + \frac{1}{x-b} + \frac{1}{x-c}$$
  answer: |
    We have $f'(x) = (x-b)(x-c) + (x-a)(x-c) + (x-a)(x-b)$ by the general multiplication rule, so we can attain the conclusion by trivial algebraic manipulation.

  question: |
    If two resistors with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in parallel, as shown in the figure, then the total resistance $R$, measured in ohms $(\Omega)$, is given by
    $$\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}.$$
    If $R_1$ and $R_2$ are increasing at rates of $0.3\Omega/\text{s}$ and $0.2\Omega/\text{s}$, respectively, how fast is $R$ changing when $R_1=80\Omega$ and $R_2=100\Omega$?

    Find the linear approximation of the function $g(x)=\sqrt[3]{1+x}$ at $a=0$ and use it to approximate the numbers $\sqrt[3]{0.95}$ nad $\sqrt[3]{1.1}$. Illustrate by graphing $g$ and the tangent line.
  answer: |
    We have $g'(x)= \frac{1}{3}(1+x)^{-2/3}$ and $g'(0)=\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $g(x)\approx g(0)+g'(0)(x-0) = 1+\frac{1}{3}x$. We then conclude that $\sqrt[3]{0.95}=g(-0.05)\approx 1-\frac{0.05}{3}$ and $\sqrt[3]{1.1} = g(0.1)\approx 1+\frac{0.1}{3}$.

    Use a linear approximation to estimate the given number, and use concavity to determine if your estimate is an over or under estimate.
    1. (1.999)^4
    2. 1/4.002
  answer: |
    1. Let f(x)=(2+x)^4. Then, $(1.999)^4 = f(-0.001)\approx f(0)+f'(0)(x-0) = 16-32\cdot 0.001$. Since $f''$ is positive near $0$, the graph of $f(x)$ is concave upward, and so the estimate is an under estimate.
    2. Let g(x)=\frac{1}{4+x}. Then, $\frac{1}{4.002}=g(0.002)\approx g(0)+g'(0)(x-0) = \frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{16}\cdot 0.002$. Since $f''$ is negative near $0$, the graph of $g(x)$ is concave downward, and so the estimate is an over estimate.
