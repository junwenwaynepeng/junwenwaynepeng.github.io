  question: |
    If two resistors with resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in parallel, as shown in the figure, then the total resistance $R$, measured in ohms $(\Omega)$, is given by
    $$\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}.$$
    If $R_1$ and $R_2$ are increasing at rates of $0.3\Omega/\text{s}$ and $0.2\Omega/\text{s}$, respectively, how fast is $R$ changing when $R_1=80\Omega$ and $R_2=100\Omega$?

    Find the linear approximation of the function $g(x)=\sqrt[3]{1+x}$ at $a=0$ and use it to approximate the numbers $\sqrt[3]{0.95}$ nad $\sqrt[3]{1.1}$. Illustrate by graphing $g$ and the tangent line.
  answer: |
    We have $g'(x)= \frac{1}{3}(1+x)^{-2/3}$ and $g'(0)=\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $g(x)\approx g(0)+g'(0)(x-0) = 1+\frac{1}{3}x$. We then conclude that $\sqrt[3]{0.95}=g(-0.05)\approx 1-\frac{0.05}{3}$ and $\sqrt[3]{1.1} = g(0.1)\approx 1+\frac{0.1}{3}$.

    Use a linear approximation to estimate the given number.
    1. (1.999)^4
    2. 1/4.002
  answer: |
    1. Let f(x)=(2+x)^4. Then, $(1.999)^4 = f(-0.001)\approx f(0)+f'(0)(x-0) = 16-32\cdot 0.001$.
    2. Let g(x)=\frac{1}{4+x}. Then, $\frac{1}{4.002}=g(0.002)\approx g(0)+g'(0)(x-0) = \frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{16}\cdot 0.002$.
