    Let $f(x,y)=\sqrt{1+x+2y}$.
      1. Find Gradient of $f$, and explain what the meaning of gradient.
      2. Find vectors $\vec{v}$ such that the directional derivative of $f$ along the vector $\vec{v}$ at $(2,3)$ is $0$.
      3. Find an equation of the tangent plain to the graph $z=f(x,y)$ when $x=2$ and $y=3$.
      4. Use the linearization of $f$ at $(2,3)$ to estimate the value of $f(2.01,2.99)$.
  answer: |
    1. $f_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x+2y}}$, $f_y = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+x+2y}}$. The gradient of a function $f$ at a point $(a,b)$ is a vector pointing to the direction where has largest directional derivative at the point, i.e.
    $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\nabla f} = \max_\vec{v}\left\{\frac{\partial f}{\partial \vec{v}}\right\}.$$
    2. We notice that $\vec{v}$ being perpendicular to $\nabla f$ follows from the following equation 
    $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\vec{v}} = \vec{v}\cdot\nabla f =0.$$
    Therefore, $\vec{v}= \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial(y)}(2,3),-\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(2,3)\right) = \left(-\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)$
