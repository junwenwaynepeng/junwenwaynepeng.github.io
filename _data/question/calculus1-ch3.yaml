q1:
  question: |
    Use the definition of the derivative to show that $\frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x))=-\sin(x)$
  answer: |
    By the definition, we directly compute
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x))=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\cos(x+h)-\cos(x)}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{-2\sin\left(\frac{2x+h}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)}{h}\\\\
    =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{-\sin\left(x+\frac{h}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)}{\frac{h}{2}}\\\\
    =-\sin(x).
    \end{align}
    $$

q4:
  question: |
    Suppose $f$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$. Show that $\frac{d}{dx}f^n(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}f'(f^{n-1}(x))$ where, conventionally, we define $f^0(x)=x$. 
  answer: not yet
q5:
  question: |
    Find the $n$th derivative of the function $f(x)=x^{n-1}\ln(x)$
  answer: |
    We process by induction to show that the requested derivative is $\frac{(n-1)!}{d}$. Consider $n=1$. The first derivative of $f(x)$ is $\frac{1}{x}$. Suppose the statement is true for some $n$. Let us prove the statement is true for $n+1$. The $n+1$ derivative is the $n$th derivative of the first dierivative of $x^{n}\ln(x)$, so it is the $n$th derivative of $nx^{n-1}+x^{n-1}$. The $n$th derivative of $x^{n-1}\ln(x)$ is $\frac{(n-1)!}{x}$ by the induction hypothesis, so we can conclude that the $n+1$th derivative is $\frac{n!}{x}$.

  question: |
    Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a function that satisfies
    $$f(x+y)=e^{-2y}f(x)+e^{2x}f(y)\text{ for all real numbers $x,y$.}$$
    1. Find $f(0)$.
    2. Prove that $f(x)$ is an odd function.
    3. Assume in addition that $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0 }\frac{f(x)}{x} = 3$.
      1. Find $f'(0)$
      2. If $f(a)=b$, find $f'(a)$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.

q9:
  question: |
    A person is walking away from a streetlight at a constant speed of 1 meter per second. The person's height is 1.8 meters, and there is a streetlight that is 5 meters above the ground. The person casts a shadow on the ground.
    1. At what rate is the person's shadow length changing when they are 10 meters away from the streetlight?
    2. Find the rate of change of the angle of elevation of the person's line of sight to the streetlight when they are 10 meters away from the streetlight.
  answer: Not yet
q10:
  question: |
    Show that $\ln(1+x)\approx x$ when $x$ is near $0$.
  answer: |
    Let $f(x)=\ln(1+x)$, so $f'(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}$. Thus, $\ln(1+x)\approx f(0)+f'(0)(x-0)=x$.
