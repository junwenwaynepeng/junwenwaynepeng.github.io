  question: |
    Suppose $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a function that satisfies
    $$f(x+y)=e^{-2y}f(x)+e^{2x}f(y)\text{ for all real numbers $x,y$.}$$
    1. Find $f(0)$.
    2. Prove that $f(x)$ is an odd function.
    3. Assume in addition that $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0 }\frac{f(x)}{x} = 3$.
      1. Find $f'(0)$
      2. If $f(a)=b$, find $f'(a)$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.
  answer: Not yet
q9:
  question: |
    A person is walking away from a streetlight at a constant speed of 1 meter per second. The person's height is 1.8 meters, and there is a streetlight that is 5 meters above the ground. The person casts a shadow on the ground.
    1. At what rate is the person's shadow length changing when they are 10 meters away from the streetlight?
    2. Find the rate of change of the angle of elevation of the person's line of sight to the streetlight when they are 10 meters away from the streetlight.
  answer: Not yet
q10:
  question: |
    Show that $\ln(1+x)\approx x$ when $x$ is near $0$.
  answer: |
    Let $f(x)=\ln(1+x)$, so $f'(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}$. Thus, $\ln(1+x)\approx f(0)+f'(0)(x-0)=x$.
