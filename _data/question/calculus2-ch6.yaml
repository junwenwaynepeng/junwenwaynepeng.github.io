    Find the volume of a solid torus which is obtained by rotating the circle $(x-R)^2+y^2=r^2$ with $R>r>0$ about the $y$-axis.
  answer: |
    **Method 1 (Cylindrical Sehlls Method)** The integral
    $$\int_{R-r}^{R+r}2\pi\cdot x\cdot 2\sqrt{r^2-(x-R)^2}dx$$
    is the volume. We apply the trig sub by letting $x-R = r\sin\theta$ and $dx = r\cos\theta d\theta$ with $\theta\in[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ to calculate this integral. That is
    $$\int 2\pi\cdot x\cdot 2\sqrt{r^2-(x-R)^2}dx = \int 4\pi (R+r\sin\theta)\cdot r\sin\theta\cdot r\cos\theta d\theta = \int 4\pi r^2R\sin\theta\cos\theta + 4\pi r^3\sin^2\theta\cos\theta d\theta.$$
    We use double angle formula to simplify the first part of the above integral, and use $u$-sub to deal with the second part. Therefore, we have
    $$\int 2\pi r^2R 2\sin\theta\cos\theta d\theta = \int 2\pi r^2R\sin(2\theta)d \theta = -rR^2\cos(2\theta)d \theta$$
    and, let $u=\sin\theta$ and $du =\cos\theta d\theta$,
    $$\int 4\pi r^3\sin^2\theta\cos\theta d\theta =\int 4\pi r^3 u^2du = \frac{4}{3}r^3u^3 = \frac{4}{3}r^3\sin^3\theta.$$
    Putting everything together, we can conclude that the desire integral is $\frac{32}{3}r^3$.

  question: |
    Let $C$ be a curve parametrized by $(x(t),y(t))$. We assume: 
    1. the curve intersects $y$-axis at $t=a$ and $t=b$ with $y(a)<y(b)$;
    2. the curve intersects with $y=c$ at exactly one point for all $c$ between $y(a)$ and $y(b)$;
    3. $x(t)>0$ for all $t\in (a,b)$.
    Explain that the area inclosed by $C$ and $y$-axis is
    $$\left|\int_a^b x(t)y'(t)dt\right|.$$
    (I want to see how you partition the entire area into tiny rectangles, and use $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ to express the area of the rectangles.) 
  answer: |
    The following figure demonstrate how we are going to partition the area. ![figure](../assets/img/question/calculus2-ch6-s-2.png)
    The tiny area is $x(t)y'(t)dt$, so the area of the region enclosed by the curves is $\left|\int_{a}^b x(t)y'(t)dt\right|$

  question: |
    Suppose $f(x)$ is a nonegative and continuous function on $[a,b]$. Find the area of the surface revolving the curve about $x$-axis, and explain your formula. 
  answer: |
    We can partition the surface into bands (see [figure](https://www.desmos.com/3d/3d838851e2)). To estimate the area of a band,  we can pretend it is a rectangle when we unfold the band on table. The width of the band can be denote by $\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}$, and the length can is $2\pi f(x)$. Thus, we derive that the area of the surface is
    $$\int_a^b 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} = \int_a^b 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}dx.$$

  question: |
    Consider a segment of the curve described by the equation $x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=1$ in the first quaudrant. 
    1. Find the arc length of the curve.
    2. Find the area of the surface revolving the curve about $x$-axis.
  answer: |
    1. Apply the implicit differentiation to the equation, we get $\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3} + \frac{2}{3}y^{1/3}y' = 0$. Thus, $y' = -\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^{1/3}$. Using the formula of arc length, we have
    $$L = \int_{0}^1 \sqrt{1+\frac{y}{x}^{2/3}}dx = \int_0^1 x^{-1/3}dx = \frac{2}{3}.$$
    2. Using the formula that we found in the previous question, the area of the surface is $\int_{0}^1(1-x^{2/3})^{3/2}\sqrt{1+\frac{y}{x}}dx.$ We calculate this integral
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int (1-x^{2/3})^{3/2}\sqrt{1+\left\frac{y}{x}\rignt)^{2/3}}dx &= \int (1-x^{2/3})^{3/2}x^{-1/3}\sqrt{x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}}dx\\\\
    &= \int (1-u^2)^{3/2} u^{-1} 3 u^2 du\ (u=x^{1/3},\text{ so }du = \frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}dx = \frac{1}{3}u^{-2}dx)\\\\
    &= \int frac{3}{2}w^{3/2} dw\ (w = 1-u^2,\text{ so }dw = -2udu)\\\\
    &= \int \frac{3}{5}w^{5/2} = \frac{3}{5}(1-u^2)^{5/2} = \frac{3}{5}(1-x^{2/3})^{5/2}.
    \end{align}
    $$
    Thus, $\int_{0}^1(1-x^{2/3})^{3/2}\sqrt{1+\frac{y}{x}}dx = \left. \frac{3}{5}(1-x^{2/3})^{5/2}\right|_0^1 = \frac{3}{5}$.
