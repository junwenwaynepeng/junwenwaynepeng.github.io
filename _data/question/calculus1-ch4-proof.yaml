    Suppose that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable on an open interval containing $[a,b]$ with $f(a)>g(a)$ and $f(b)>g(b)$. If $f(x)=g(x)$ has exactly one solution on $[a,b]$, denoted by $x_0\in [a,b]$, then $f$ and $g$ have the same tangent line at $x=x_0$.

    Suppose that the function $f$ is differentiable on an open interval containing $[a,b]$ with $a>0$. If $f(a)=ka$ and $f(b)=kb$ for some $k$, then there exists $c\in (a,b)$ such that the tangent line of $y=f(x)$ at $c$ passes through the origin.
  answer: |
    Considering the function $g(x)=\frac{f(x)}{x}$, we have $g(a)=g(b)=k$. By the mean value theorem, there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that $g'(c)=\frac{f'(c)c-f(c)}{c^2}=0$. It implies $cf'(c)=f(c)$ which is equivalent to say the tangent line at $(c,f(c))$ passes thought the origin.

    Suppose that $f$ is a differentiable function on an open interval containing $[a,b]$. If $f'(a)>0$ and $f'(b)<0$, then there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$.
  answer: Let $g(x)=f(x)-f(a)$

    Let $a<b$. A function $f$ is said to be contractive on $[a,b]$ if there exists $K$ with $0<k<1$ such that for all $x_1,\ x_2\in[a,b]$, we have
    $$|f(x_1)-f(x_2)|\leq k|x_1-x_2|$$.
    1. If $f$ is contractive on $[a,b]$, then  $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
    2. If $f$ is continuous and differentiable on $[a,b]$ with $|f'(x)|\leq q$, $0<q<1$, for all $x\in(a,b)$, then $f$ is contractive on $[a,b]$ and has at most one fixed point on $[a,b]$

  question: |
    If $f(x)$ is differentiable and $f'(x)\neq 1$ for all real numbers $x$, then $f$ has at most one fixed point.
  answer: |
    We need to show that if $f$ has fixed points, then $f$ has at most one fixed point. Let $g(x)=f(x)-x$. Then, it is equivalent to show that $g(x)=0$ has at most one solution. If there exists two solutions $a$ and $b$, then there exists a $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $g'(c)=0$ by mean value theorem. However, $g'(c)=0$ implies $f'(c)=1$, which contradicts to the assumption. Thus, we can conclude that $f(x)$ has at most one fixed point.

    Let $0<a<b$. Show that $\dfrac{b-a}{b}<\ln\dfrac{b}{a}<\dfrac{b-a}{a}.$
  answer: |
    Consider the function $f(x)=\ln(x)$. By the mean value theorem, there exists a real number $c$ with $a<c<b$ such that
    $$
    \ln\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)=\ln(b)-\ln(a)=\frac{1}{c}(b-a).
    $$
    Note that $a<c<b$ implies $\frac{1}{a}>\frac{1}{c}>\frac{1}{b}$. Putting everything together, we have the desired conclusion.

    Show that if $f$ is a continuous function on an open interval contaning $[a,b]$ with $f(a)f(b)<0$ and $f'(x)>0$ for all $x\in [a,b]$, then $f$ has a unique zero (solution of $f(x)=0$) in $[a,b]$.
