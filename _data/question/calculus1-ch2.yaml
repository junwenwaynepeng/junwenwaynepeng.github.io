q3:
  question: |
    Which of the following statements is true?

    1. If $g(x)$ is continuous, then $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0}f(g(x)) = f(\lim_{x\to 0}g(x))$.
    2. If $f$ is one-to-one and onto, then $f$ is strictly increasing or decreasing.
    3. $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a}f(x)+g(x)=\lim_{x\to a}f(x)+\lim_{x\to a}g(x)$ only if both $f$ and $g$ are continuous.
    4. If a function is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, then it attains its maximum and minimum values on that interval.
    5. There exists an example where either $f$ or $g$ is not continuous, but $f(x)g(x)$ is continuous.
    6. If $f$ is not differentiable at $x=0$, then $f^2$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.

q7:
  question: |
    Use the definition of limit to prove that if $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x) = L>0$, we can find a number $N$ such that $f(x)>0$ for all $x>N$.
  answer: not yet

q8:
  question: |
    We say a real function (i.e., both the domain and the codomain of $f$ are subsets of real numbers) has the intermediate value property if for any two values $a$ and $b$ in the domain of $f$, and any $y$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exists some $c$ such that $f(c)=y$. Such a function is referred to as a *Darboux function*. Is it always the case that a Darboux function is continuous? If not, please provide an example. (Hint: you have already seen this function.)
