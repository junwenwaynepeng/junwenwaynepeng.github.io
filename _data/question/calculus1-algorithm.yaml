    Newton's method is an iterative numerical technique used to approximate solutions for equations, often employed to find the roots of real-valued functions. Below is a pseudocode representation of Newton's method:

    ```python
    Goal: Find an approximate solution x1 to the equation f(x) = 0.
    Input: A function (f), an initial value (x0), a tolerance error (err), and a maximum number of iterations (m).
    Return: An approximate solution x1 with |f(x1)| less than err or reaching the maximum number of iterations.
    Code:
    def NewtonMethod(f, x0, err, m):
        x = x0
        iteration = 0
        while iteration < m:
            if abs(f(x)) < err:
                return x
            if f'(x) == 0:
                return "No solution found"
            x = x - f(x) / f'(x)  # Find the x-intercept of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at (x, f(x))
            iteration = iteration + 1
        return "Exceeded the maximum number of iterations"
    ```

    Your task is to implement the provided pseudocode in Sage/Python or any language you are used to use and use your code to approximate the solution of the equation $\cos(x) = x^2 - 4$ to six decimal places.
