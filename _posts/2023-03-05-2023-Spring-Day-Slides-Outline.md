# 2023 Spring Day Slides Outline

1. Title

2. Introduce the question
	* Decomposition, Ritt's decomposition theorem and Laurent's Theorem
	* Composition relation
	* near ring & semigroup

3. Past result
	* $f^n = g^n$ implies they have the "same" julia set.
	* Even we knew the above properties, there is a huge gap to conclude that $<f,g>$ is a free genereated semigroup.
	* If $h_f\neq h_g$, then there exists an integer $N$ such that $<f^N, g^N>$ is free.

4. Introduce height
	* Introduce naive height
	* Introduce dynamical canonical height
	* A test of the proof that shows the dynamical canonical height is well-defined
	* Northcott theorem

5. Key Observation
	* Revisit the proof
	* How do we prove our past result

6. Idea of Algorithm
	* We have right canceallation (No left canceallation)
	* Search on the tree

7. Algorithm
	* algorithm

8. Algorithm Complexity
	* estimate the complexity

9. Experiment result
	* show datas

10. Further questions
	* Investigate the gap of canonical heights
	* Show data
