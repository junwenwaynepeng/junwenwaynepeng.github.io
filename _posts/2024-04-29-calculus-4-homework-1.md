1. This exercise demonstrates a connection between the curl vector and rotations. Let $B$ be a rigid body rotating about the $z$-axis. The rotation can be described by the vector $\mathbf{w}=\omega\mathbf{k}$, where $\omega$ is the angular speed of $B$, that is, the tangential speed of any point $P$ in $B$ divided by the distance $d$ from the axis of rotation. Let $\mathbf{r}=\langle x,y,z\rangle$ be the position vector of $P$.
	1. By considering the angle $\theta$ in the figure, show that the velocity field of $B$ is given by $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{r}$.
	2. Show that $\mathbf{v}=-\omega y\mathbf{i}+\omega x\mathbf{j}$.
	3. Show that curl $\mathbf{v}=2\mathbf{w}$.

2. Let $z$ be a complex number $x+yi$ where $i$ is the imaginary number, i.e., $i^2=-1$.
	1. Rewrite the complex function $f(z)=\frac{1}{z}$ as a vector field $F$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
	2. Prove that $\int_{C_1}F\cdot d\gamma=\int_{C_2}F\cdot d\gamma$ for any closed simple curve $C_1$ and $C_2$ enclosing the origin.
	3. Show that $\int_{C}F\cdot d\gamma =2\pi$ for any closed simple curve $C$ enclosing the origin.
	4. Demonstrate that $\int_{C_n}F\cdot d\gamma =2n\pi$ for any closed curve $C_n$ enclosing the origin, where $n$ denotes the number of times the curve circles the origin.
