This post is a brief summary of my discussion with Kyla. She recommended that I enhance the survey by:

1. Formulating a central question and basing the survey design around it.
2. Gathering data related to precalculus.

## New idea


In educational theory, there's a chain of activities that impact learning:


> ðŸ’¡ Interactive > Construction > Active Learning > Passive Learning


**Passive Learning:** Listening to class lectures


**Active Learning:** Taking notes during class


**Construction:** Not specified


**Interactive:** Conversations between experts and learners


If I consider AI as an expert that can aid in student learning, I must question whether a student interacts with AI.
