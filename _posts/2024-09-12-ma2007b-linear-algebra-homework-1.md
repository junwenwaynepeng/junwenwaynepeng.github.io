1. Under what condition on $y_1$ , $y_2$ , $y_3$ do the points $(0, y_1 )$, $(1, y_2 )$,
$(2, y_3 )$ lie on a straight line?
2. Use elimination to solve

$$
\begin{cases}
u + v + w = 6\\\\
u + 2v + 2w = 11\\\\
2u + 3v − 4w = 3
\end{cases}
$$


and



$$
\begin{cases}
u + v + w = 7\\\\
u + 2v + 2w = 10\\\\
2u + 3v − 4w = 3\\\\
\end{cases}
$$

1. Prove the following statements:
	1. Prove that if the determinant of the coefficient matrix for the following system of linear equations

		$$
		\begin{cases}
		ax+by=k\\\\
		cx+dy=l
		\end{cases}
		$$


		is non-zero, then this system has a solution.

	2. Prove that if a system of two linear equations with two unknowns has more than one solution, it must have infinitely many solutions.
