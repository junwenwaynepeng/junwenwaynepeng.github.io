1. Define addition and scalar multiplication on the set $\\{(a_1,a_2,\ldots)|a_i\in\mathbb{R}\\}$ to prove that it forms a vector space.
2. Let's define a _differential operation_ $D:V\to V$ as

	$$
	D(\{a_n\})=\{a_{n+1}-a_{n}|n=1,2,3,\ldots\}.
	$$


	Show that the set of solutions of $D^2-2D+3=\\{0\\}$ forms a subspace of the above vector space, where $\\{0\\}$ is the sequence of $0$. We define $D^2(\\{a_n\\})=D(D(\\{a_n\\}))$ and $(D^2-2D+3)(\\{a_n\\})=D^2(\\{a_n\\})-2\cdot D(\\{a_n\\})+3\cdot\\{a_n\\}.$

3. Prove that $\\{(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\\}$ has infinite dimension. Then use this result to deduce that the set of all real functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$ also has infinite dimension.
4. If a vector space $V$ is generated by a finite set $S_0$, then a subset of $S_0$ is a basis for $V$. Hence $V$ has a finite basis.
5. Develop a strategy to address the following problem: Given a finite set $S$ in a vector space $V$, which may generate either $V$ or a subspace of $V$, find a subset of $S$ that forms a basis for $\text{span}(S)$.
6. Use the strategy you developed above to find the subset in the set $\\{(2,-3,5,0),(8,-12,20,2),(1,0,-2,4),(0,2,-1,3),(7,2,0,1)\\}$
7. For the following questions, prove that $T$ is a linear transformation and find bases for both $N(T)$ and $R(T)$. Then compute the nullity and rank of $T$ and verify the equality

	$$
	\text{nullity}(T)+\text{rank}(T)=\text{dim}(T)
	$$


	and determine whether $T$ is one-to-one or onto.

	1. $T:P_2(\mathbb{R})\to P_3(\mathbb{R})$; $T(f(x))=xf(x)+f'(x).$
	2. $T:M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb{R}$; $T(A)=\text{Trace}(A)$. Recall that

		$$
		\text{Trace}(A)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}
		$$


		where $A=(a_{ij})$.
