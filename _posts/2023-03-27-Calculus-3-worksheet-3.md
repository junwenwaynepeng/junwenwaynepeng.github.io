1. Compute the following double integral
	* $\int\int_{\Omega}\frac{1}{1+x+y}dxdy$, $\Omega: [0,1]\times[0,2]$. (Hint: it requires integration by part for $\int\ln(x)dx$.)
	* $\int\int_{\Omega}\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}^2dxdy$, $\Omega:[1,2]\times[1,3]$. (Hint: we are going to apply integration by part twice.)
2. Explain $\int\int_{\Omega}1dxdy$ is the area of $\Omega$.
3. Consider the region $\Omega$ enclosed by the lines $x=4$, $y=\frac{1}{2}x+2$, and $y=-x$, as shown in the following image. Determine the bounds of $x$ and $y$ for the region $\Omega$.![figure 1](..assets/img/2022-Calculus-3/worksheet-3-1.png)
4. Consider the region $\Omega$ defined by $0 < x < 2$ and $0 < y < x^2$. Rewrite the inequality so that instead of bounding $x$ by constants and bounding $y$ by functions, we will bound $y$ by constants and $x$ by functions.
