# Calculus 3 Worksheet 2

1. There are two methods to find tangent plain of a surface. In this question, we will explore these two methods.
	* Consider $z=f(x,y)$, and suppose the first order partial derivative of $f$ are exists. Please write down a formula of the tangent plain of $f$ at $(a,b)$ in terms of $\partial f/\partial x$, $\partial f/\partial y$.
	* Consider $c=f(x,y,z)$. Explain why this is a "level surface". Suppose $(a,b,c)$ is a solution, i.e. $c=f(a,b,c)$, please use the gradient Theorem (the only theorem that we introduced on the last Thursday) to find the tangent plain at the point.
	* How can we use the second method to compute the tangent plain of $z=f(x,y)$?
	* Use either method to calculate the tangent space of $z=\dfrac{xy^2}{x^2+y^2}$ at $(1,1)$.

2. Suppose
	\[f(x,y)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{xy^2}{x^2+y^2}\ & if (x,y)\neq (0,0) \\\ 0,\ & if (x,y)=(0,0)\end{cases}.\]
	* Find $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}$
	* Find $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}$
	* Show that $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}(0,0)\neq \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}(0,0).$
