In our seventh class, we began by reviewing Lagrange multipliers and discussing finding extreme values on a surface with an open relation.

## Technique of solving the system of equations given by the method of Lagrange multipliers
Let me brief on a general stratage to solve the system of equations given by the method of Lagrange multipliers. We observe that $\lambda$ only appear in the first and the second equation, so if we devide them, the Lagrange multiplier will be eliminate. Put the resulting equation and the third equation (constrain) to gether, we should get a system equation in two equations and two unknows. This system of equation is usually doable. Let me put the above discussion in the following summary.
\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lambda\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lambda\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\\
g(x,y)=c
\end{cases}
\Rightarrow
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial f/\partial x}{\pargial f\partial y} = \frac{\partial g/\partial x}{\partial g/\partial y}
g(x,y)=c
\end{cases}
\]

After a brief history of how we got to where we are today, we introduced double integrals. We started by using single-variable calculus to calculate the length of a graph y=f(x) for x from a to b, and then used the disk method to find the volume when we rotated the curve along the x-axis (which can be generalized to rotate along any y=c), and used the shell method to find the volume of a cylinder given a closed area and rotated along the y-axis (generalized version is x=c).

Next, we introduced double integrals and discussed what Omega means in the integration. We claimed that the order of dx and dy would not affect the value of the integration in this course, but computationally, sometimes one order of integration might be much easier than the other. These two levels (dxdy and dydx are equivalent, and one order is easier than the other order) can only deal with double integrals when Omega is a rectangle, i.e., $\Omega=[a,b]\times[c,d]$. However, if one side is bounded by a function, then we need the Fubini theorem. We went over two examples, and the second example was not finished yet, which we plan to complete in the next class.
