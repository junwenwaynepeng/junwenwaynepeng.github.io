## Remark

1. In Question 3, we use simply compare values to determine the maximum or minimum on the boundary. While we acknowledge that this method is not entirely rigorous, we have not covered a more rigorous method in this course.
2. It is recommended that you review the **double angle formula** before the midterm.
3. We did not explicitly introduce the second method used in Question 6. We suggest that you review the method.
