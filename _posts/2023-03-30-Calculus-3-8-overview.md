In the 8th class, we started with a quick review of the concept of double integrals and went over a few examples to practice the technique of integrating a function over a region in the plane. We discussed how the order of integration can sometimes be important, and that it is essential to determine the limits (boundary conditions) of x and y of an area $\Omega$ in order to evaluate a double integral correctly.

We then talked about the technique of switching between controlling y by x or controlling x by y, depending on which order of integration is easier. We went over a few examples to illustrate how switching between orders of integration can make a computation easier or more difficult.

Next, we introduced the concept of polar coordinates. We explained how polar coordinates are different from Euclidean coordinates, and how we can transform between the two coordinate systems. We discussed how a point in polar coordinates is represented by an angle $\theta$ and a radius $r$, and how we can find the x and y values of a point in Euclidean coordinates using the formulas $x = r\cos(\theta)$ and $y = r\sin(\theta)$.

Finally, we talked about how to find the limits of $\Omega$ in polar coordinates. We explained how to express the boundaries of a region in polar coordinates, and how to use these boundaries to set up a double integral in polar coordinates. We went over a few examples to illustrate the technique of finding limits in polar coordinates and showed how the process is similar to finding limits in Euclidean coordinates.
