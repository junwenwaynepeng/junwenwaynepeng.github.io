Green's Theorem is a fundamental concept in vector calculus that establishes a relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve and a double integral over the plane region it encloses. Named after the British mathematician George Green, this theorem serves as a vital tool in physics and engineering for solving problems related to fluid flow, electricity, and magnetism.


**Theorem(Green).** Let $F(x,y)=P(x,y)i+Q(x,y)j$ be a vector field in $C^1$ class. For a positively oriented, piecewise smooth simple closed curve C and the region D it encloses, i.e. $\partial D=C$, we have


$$
\int_CPdx+Qdy=\iint_D\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}dA
$$


Green's Theorem can be intuitively understood by thinking of the left side of the equation as the circulation around the boundary of a region, and the right side as the sum of the circulations around infinitesimally small loops within the region. In other words, the total circulation around the boundary of a region is equal to the sum of the circulations within the region. This theorem essentially bridges the gap between local behavior (differential forms) and global behavior (integral forms) in a two-dimensional field. We will show more details when we introduce curl.


**proof.** We will only prove Green's theorem when $D$ is a type one and also a type two region.

We claim 


$$
\int_CPdx = -\iint_D\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}dydx\quad\text{and}\quad\int_CQdy =\iint_D\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}dydx.
$$


Use the assumption that $D$ is of type one, we can show the left equality. Let $D=\\{(x,y)|a\leq x\leq b, g(x)\leq y\leq h(x)\\}$. Then, a direct computation confirms the equality, that is


$$
\begin{align*}
\int_a^b\left(\int_{g(x)}^{h(x)}\frac{\partial }{\partial y}Pdy\right)dx &= \int_a^bP(x,h(x))-P(x,g(x))dx\\\\
&=\int_a^bP(x,h(x))dx+\int_b^aP(x,g(x))dx.
\end{align*}
$$


Note that these two integrals represent the line integral with respect to $x$ on the top and bottom curves that bound $D$. Moreover, the vertical line has $dx=0$, so $\int_{x=a}Pdx=\int_{x=b}Pdx = 0$. Therefore, we have


$$
\begin{align*}
\int_a^bP(x,h(x))dx&+\int_b^aP(x,g(x))dx = \int_a^bP(x,h(x))dx+\int_b^aP(x,g(x))dx\\\\
&=\int_a^bP(x,h(x))dx+\int_b^aP(x,g(x))dx + \int_{x=a}Pdx+\int_{x=b}Pdx\\\\
&=\int_CPdx.
\end{align*}
$$


Similarly, using the assumption that $D$ can be expressed as a type two region, we can show the other equality.


# Finding Area by Green's Theorem


We know that $A(D)=\iint_DdA$. So, to use Green's theorem to find area, we require to find $P$ and $Q$ such that


$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=1
$$


The solution of $P$ and $Q$ are not unique, and we have the following three candidates:


$$
\begin{cases}
P=0\\\\
Q=x
\end{cases},\quad
\begin{cases}
P=-y\\\\
Q=0
\end{cases},\quad\text{and}\quad
\begin{cases}
P=-\frac{1}{2}y\\\\
Q=\frac{1}{2}x
\end{cases}
$$


# Extended Versions of Green's theorem


To extend the application of Green's theorem to more general regions, consider the example of a donut-shaped region, also known as an annular region $D$ (bounded by outer and inner circles). This region is not simple as it contains a hole. To apply Green's theorem, divide the annular region into upper and lower half. For the upper half of the semiannular, we provide a positively oriented path represented by $C_1+C_2+C_3+C_4$. Similarly, for the lower half of the semiannular, the positively oriented path is represented by $C_1'+C_4'+C_3'+C_2'$.

Since $C_2$ and $C_2'$ (as well as $C_4$ and $C_4'$) are in opposite directions, their line integrals will cancel out. That is


$$
\begin{align*}
&\int_{C_1}Fd\gamma + \int_{C_2}Fd\gamma + \int_{C_3}Fd\gamma + \int_{C_4}Fd\gamma + \int_{C'_1}Fd\gamma + \int_{C'_2}Fd\gamma + \int_{C'_3}Fd\gamma + \int_{C'_4}Fd\gamma\\\\
&=\int_{C_1+C_1'}Fd\gamma - \int_{-(C_3+C_3')}Fd\gamma
\end{align*}
$$


Let $B$ (big circle) be the region bounded by outer circle, and let $B'$e (small circle) be the region bounded by the inner circle. Applying Green's theorem to $C_1+C_1'$ and $-(C_3+C_3')$, we have


$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{C_1+C_1'}Fd\gamma - \int_{-(C_3+C_3')}Fd\gamma &= \iint_B\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}dA - \iint_{B'}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}dA\\\\
&= \iint_D\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}dA.
\end{align*}
$$


The extended version of Green's theorem is frequently used to demonstrate that the integral of a loop does not depend on the loop's path or initial point, but solely on the number of poles (undefined point) provided by the function.
