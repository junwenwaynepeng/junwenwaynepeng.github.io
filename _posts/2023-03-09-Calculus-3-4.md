# Calculus 3-4 Gradient, Directional Derivative, Theorem of Gradient, Applications and Higher Order Partial Derivative

1. Gradient and directional derivative
	* The gradient of a function at a point is a **vector** that points in the direction of **maximum increase of the function** at the point the **length of gradient is the directional derivative along the gradient**.
	* The directional derivative of a function is the rate at which the function changes as you move in a specified direction.
	* The following we give formula of gradient and directional derivative
	\[\nabla f(a,b)=\left(\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b), \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b)\right)\text{ and } \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \vec{u}}=\nabla f(a,b)\cdot\dfrac{\vec{u}}{|\vec{u}|}.\]
The gradient and directional derivative can be computed using partial derivatives of the function.
The Gradient Theorem
The Gradient Theorem states that the gradient of a function at a particular point is perpendicular to the level curve of the function at that point.
The first part of the theorem states that the gradient of a function at a particular point points in the direction of the maximum rate of increase of the function at that point.
The second part of the theorem states that if the level curves of a function are densely packed in a region, then the gradient of the function is larger in that region.
Application to find tangent space
The tangent space of a surface at a particular point is the plane that is tangent to the surface at that point.
The Gradient Theorem can be used to find the normal vector of the tangent plane at a particular point on the surface.
To find the tangent space of a surface defined by f(x,y,z) = C, we can first find
