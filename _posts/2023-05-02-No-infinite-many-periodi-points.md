In 1998, Francesco Amoroso and Roberto Dvornicich proved Lehmer's conjecture to be true for abelian extensions. This implies that there exists an absolute gap between the Weil height of non-torsion points and torsion points in any abelian extension.

Later, in 2001, Bombieri and Zannier demonstrated the truth of the Northcott theorem for any subfield of $K^{(d)}$, where $K^{(d)}$ denotes the composition of all degree-$d$ field extensions of $K$. Clayton Petsche and Emerald Stacy later provided different approaches to this result.

The overall aim of this problem is to understand the relationship between field extensions, height, and the number of torsion points. For any finite extension $K$ over a number field, the Northcott theorem allows us to deduce that the height $h(K)$ is not dense in $K$. We are especially interested in the distribution of torsion points which are exactly height-$0$ points in $K$. Amoroso and Dvornicich showed that even though there are infinitely many torsion points, 0 is still an isolated point in $h(K)$. Bombieri and Zannier extended this result to a more general setting by demonstrating that 0 is always an isolated point, no matter how small the gap is. Furthermore, we won't obtain infinitely many torsion points by adding infinitely many non-torsion points.

What happens if $0$ is no longer an isolated point in $h(K)$? Can we find a sequence of points $(\alpha_n)$ such that $h(\alpha_n)$ and $\alpha_n$ converge to $0$ and a torsion point, respectively? We address this question by studying the following family of rational maps, which has only finitely many periodic points even if we have an infinite sequence $(\alpha_n)$ with canonical height converging to $0$.
