# Definition of Derivatives

For a function $f(x)$, the *derivative* $f'(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as it approaches zero:
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$

We say $f$ is *differentiable* at $x=c$, if the $f'(c)$ exists.

**Theorem.** If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x=c$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$.

We will use the definition of derivatives to calculate the derivatives of functions if the functions are either basic functions or conditional functions.
