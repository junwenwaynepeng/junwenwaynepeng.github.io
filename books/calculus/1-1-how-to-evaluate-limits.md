# How to evaluate limits

## Kill a common zero and the rationalization

There are two scenarios where you might want to consider employing this technique. The first scenario arises when you encounter an indeterminate form, specifically $\frac{0}{0}$, and the denominator takes the form of $\sqrt{\cdot}-\sqrt{\cdot}$ or $1-\cos(x)$. The second scenario occurs when you are working with a limit as $x$ approaches infinity, and direct evaluation leads to the indeterminate form $\infty - \infty$. These are two common situations where the technique we'll discuss becomes particularly useful.

To illustrate these scenarios, let's explore several typical examples.

**Example 1.** $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{|x^2+2|}-\sqrt{|x^2-2|}}$

**Example 2.** $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{x+1}$

**Example 3.** $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^2}{1-\cos(x)}$
