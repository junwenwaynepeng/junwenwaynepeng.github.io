# Orthogonal trajectories

Given a family of curves $\{C_k\}$ where $k$ is a parameter that can be expressed by $x$ and $y$, an orthogonal trajectory of the family is a curve $C$ such that every intersection of $C$ and $C_i$ are perpendicular. To find $C$, we follow the following steps:

**Step 1** Find $\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$ of $C_k$

**Step 2** Replace $k$ in $f(x,y)$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.

**Step 3** Let $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{f(x,y)}$

**Step 4** Solve the last ODE.
