	    # Composition and Decomposition

	    Performing composition with rational functions $f$ and $g$ is straightforward. However, decomposing a function $F$ can be a challenging task.
	    $$ \frac{x^2+1}{2x}\circ \frac{2x+1}{x^2-1}=\frac{5x^2+4x}{4x^3+x^2-4x-1}$$

  	<h2>Ritt's Decomposition Theorem</h2>
  	<p>We say $F_1\circ\F_2\circ\cdots\F_n$ is a complete decomposition of $F$</p>
